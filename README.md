# Concrete-Abstract-Interface-Demo
This is a quick little interface and abstract class demo. 

Clone repo into your IDE, then run the main method from the main class.
Look a the output. Then check out the comments in each of the class files.

I'm pretty sure this is helpful but let me know if you see anything thats not right.
